    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <div class="thing"><img src="images/Harper-10.jpg">

        <div class="item">
            <p class="indent">Hello! My name is Erin. I’m a recently moved psychology graduate from St. Louis, Missouri.
                I now live in
                Atlanta, Georgia with my wonderful boyfriend and two cats, Sabi and Ori. I’m a proud nerdy ambivert that
                loves historical fantasy, gaming, literature, anime, Dungeons&Dragons, drawing, self-improvement,
                nutrition, wellness and sweets! You can easily win my undivided attention with a slice of cake. </p>

            <p class="indent">For a long time, I thought I’d be working in health for either animals or people. As a
                child, I aspired
                to work in veterinary medicine. After high school, I found my love for mental health and therapy, and
                thought I’d go into occupational therapy. After I graduated college, however, I found I was happiest
                typing away code on my computer.</p>

            <p class="indent">It’s a field that brought out my dormant creativity and love for puzzle-solving. While I
                still love caring for both animals and people, I’m hoping a career in code will pull it together via
                indirect work on
                useful applications, websites and resources.</p>

            <p class="indent">At present, I consider myself a beginner. I first learned about coding languages through
                my boyfriend and
                began my own learning with courses on Udemy. I enjoy working with HTML and CSS, and am still getting the
                hang of Python and Javascript. I don’t have the best memory, so it’s nice to have access to online
                resources while I learn. I’m grateful for the opportunity to work alongside a team at DigitalCrafts and
                look forward to meeting everyone in May!
            </p>

            <p>See you soon!</p>
